First go get an API key from "http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/member/register"

In this project you will be accessing the Rotten Tomatoes API to allow a user to search for movies, get details on a specific movie, and mark a specific movie as a favorite.

Some of the work is already done. For instance, the Networking and model _should_ be working, and most of the Detail Page has been completed. You will need to:

-Build the SearchVC (the initial VC for the app) Please see the enclosed "Search" image. 

-Add Favoriting in the Detail View.
â€”-This needs to persist through app sessions.

-Add a way to view all Favorited movies from the SearchVC
